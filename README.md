## Prereqs
> To make sure this program runs as designed Python 3.8 
> should be installed. This project has many modules incorporated,
> some of which are not included by default. Any missing modules
> have to be installed with PIP before the program can run. I recommend
> simply enter the module name in search engine and finding the documentation. The 
> PIP command for installation is usually one of the first things mentioned.
> Also with Python it is common to have multiple modules with a similar names.
> So if errors are being raised about not having a certain module it is
> most likely the wrong module with a similar name to the one that is required
> was installed instead of the required module.

## Installation
> Enter Python downloads in a search engine and obtain version 3.8 from the official website. 
> Run the installer and follow the default installation procedures. 
> Also search for any required modules and install them with PIP in Command Prompt.
